1) **Write a program to find whether the no entered by the user is even or odd.**
```
Enter a number: 15
The number 15 is ODD!

Enter a number: 16
The number 16 is EVEN!
```

2) **Write a program to swap the values of 2 nos. (Take input from the user).**
```
Enter 2 numbers: 10 20

Before swap: 
Number 1: 10	Number 2: 20

After swap: 
Number 1: 20	Number 2: 10
```

3) **Write a program to find the greatest between the 3 nos and display the output. (Take input from the user).**
```
Enter 3 numbers: 25 15 10
The greatest number is: 25
```

4) **Write a program to find whether the character entered by the user is a vowel or not. (Solve by using if..else and switch case).**
```
Enter a character: a
The character a is a VOWEL!

Enter a character: z
The character z is a CONSONANT!
```

5) **Write a program to print even nos from 1-50 using while loop.**
```
Even numbers from 1-50: 
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50
```

6) **Write a program to print odd nos from 50-100 using do-while loop.**
```
Odd numbers from 50-100: 
51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99
```

7) **Given a number N, print sum of all even numbers from 1 to N.**
```
Enter a number: 20
Sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is: 110
```

8) **Write a program to print the following patterns:**
```
-----Pattern 1-----
Enter a number: 5
1
22
333
4444
55555

-----Pattern 2-----
Enter a number: 4
4444
4444
4444
4444

-----Pattern 3-----
Enter a number: 6
     *
    **
   ***
  ****
 *****
******
```

9) **Write a program to reverse an Array.**
```
Enter the size of the array: 4
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4

Before reversing: 
1 2 3 4 
After reversing: 
4 3 2 1 
```

10) **Write a program to Swap the nos in Array.**
```
Enter the size of the arrays: 5

Enter the elements of the First Array: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the elements of the Second Array: 6 7 8 9 10

-----Before Swapping-----
First Array: 
1 2 3 4 5 
Second Array: 
6 7 8 9 10 

-----After Swapping-----
First Array: 
6 7 8 9 10 
Second Array: 
1 2 3 4 5 
```

11) **Write a program to calculate and display the factorial of a no entered by the user.**
```
Enter the number: 10
The factorial of 10 is: 3628800
```

12) **Write a program to check whether the no entered by the user is prime or not.**
```
Enter the number: 3
The number 3 is a PRIME NUMBER!

Enter the number: 4
The number 4 is a COMPOSITE NUMBER!
```

13) **Given an integer N, print all the prime numbers that lie in the range 2 to N (both inclusive).**
```
Enter the number: 100

Prime numbers between 2 and 100: 
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 
```

14) **Write a program to generate the reverse of a given number N. Print the corresponding reverse number.**
```
Enter the number: 1024
The reverse of 1024 is: 4201
```
